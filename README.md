Description: Welcome to the Codsoft Internship Data Science Repository! Here, you'll find a showcase of my journey and achievements during the internship, featuring hands-on projects that delve into various facets of data science. Dive into the realm of predictive analytics and classification with the following projects:

1. Titanic Survival Prediction
   
   Problem Statement: Build a model that will return a passengers survival chance given a passengers detail as input.

2. Sales Prediction Using Python

   Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as
   advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.

3. Movie Rating Prediction

   Description: In this project, I built a movie rating prediction system using Python. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, and the development of a 
   machine-learning model to predict movie ratings.
    
Feel free to explore the code, and documentation provided in each project. Your feedback and insights are greatly appreciated as I continue to refine and expand my skills in the dynamic field of data science. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ“Š
